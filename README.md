Hey! I'm currently learning Python, I've used Java a little in the past. 
Really enjoying Python and looking forward to creating some cool things.

I spent last summer messing around with nested virtualisation on google cloud compute using LineageOS and KVM on Ubuntu,
then used SPICE protocol to access the nested android VM remotely.

Im interested in learning more about deep learning & AI as well as networking and shortcomings in current remote access methods.
